The code defines two classes, Person and Employee. The Person class has two attributes, name and age, along with getters and setters for these attributes.

The Employee class inherits from Person and adds three additional attributes: salary, rank, and job, along with corresponding getters and setters.

In the main function, an Employee object named emp is created with the name "John Doe", age 30, salary $50000, rank "Manager", and job "Engineering".

The attributes of the emp object are then printed to the console using the getters of the Employee class.
